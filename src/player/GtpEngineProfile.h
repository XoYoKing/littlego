/// @brief The GtpEngineProfile class collects settings that define the
/// behaviour of the GTP engine.
///
/// There is always one GtpEngineProfile object that is used for human vs. human
/// games. This profile is the fallback profile if no other profile is
/// available or appropriate. The user cannot delete the human vs. human games
/// profile.
///
/// Circumstances where the human vs. human games profile is used:
/// - If a game is started where both players are human
/// - If a profile is deleted that is still associated with a Player object,
///   then that Player object is re-associated with another profile. If the only
///   profile that still exists is the human vs. human games profile, then that
///   profile is used as the fallback.
///
///
/// @par Active profile
///
/// The active GTP engine profile is the one with whose settings the GTP is
/// currently configured.
///
/// A profile becomes active when its applyProfile() method is invoked. If
/// another profile is already active, applyProfile() deactivates that profile.
/// Only one profile at a time can be active.
///
/// When the application launches there is a brief span of time during which
/// the GTP engine is not yet configured, and during which there is no active
/// profile.
///
///
/// @par Playing strength
///
/// The value of the @e playingStrength property of a GtpEngineProfile denotes
/// the relative playing strength of a computer player that uses the profile.
/// A lower value indicates a weaker player, while a higher value indicates a
/// stronger player.
///
/// Each playing strength value represents a certain pre-defined (i.e.
/// hardcoded) combination of GTP engine settings. Changing a GtpEngineProfile's
/// playing strength will result in the profile's settings being updated to the
/// combination of values that represent the new playing strength. Only playing
/// strengths in the range between #minimumPlayingStrength and
/// #maximumPlayingStrength can be assigned. An exception is raised if you try
/// to assign any other value.
///
/// When querying the property, the value #customPlayingStrength indicates an
/// unknown (i.e. not pre-defined) combination of profile settings.
///
///
/// @par Resign behaviour
///
/// The value of the @e resignBehaviour property of a GtpEngineProfile denotes
/// how quickly a computer player that uses the profile will resign. Higher
/// values indicate that the computer player will play more stubborn, i.e. it
/// is less likely that the computer player will resign. The highest value
/// (#maximumResignBehaviour) indicates that the computer player will never
/// resign.
///
/// Each resign behaviour represents a bias used to modify the default resign
/// threshold values for each board size. The bias is a simple multiplier.
/// Resign behaviours do not modify @e fuegoResignMinGames, they let this
/// property be auto-managed by setting autoSelectFuegoResignMinGames to true.
///
/// When querying the property, the value #customResignBehaviour indicates an
/// unknown (i.e. not pre-defined) resign behaviour.
