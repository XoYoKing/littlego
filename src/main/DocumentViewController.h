/// @brief The DocumentViewController class is responsible for loading an HTML
/// resource file and displaying the content in its view (a WKWebView object).
/// Alternatively, a client may provide the HTML document content as a string to
/// DocumentViewController upon creation.
///
/// The GUI has a number of web views that display different documents such as
/// the "About" information document. If DocumentViewController is not
/// instantiated via one of its convenience constructors, it recognizes which
/// document it is supposed to load by examining the @e uiArea property that
/// is expected to exist via category addition.
///
/// If DocumentViewController is instantiated via one of its convenience
/// constructors, it either just displays the provided HTML document, or loads
/// and displays the resource named in the constructor.
///
/// @todo Research how much memory this controller and its associated view are
/// using. If possible, try to reduce the memory requirements (e.g. only create
/// one instance of the controller/view pair instead of one instance per
/// document).
