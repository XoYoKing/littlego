/// @brief The TableViewVariableHeightCell class implements a custom table view
/// cell that in general looks like UITableViewCellStyleValue1, with the
/// exception that the two text labels are adjusted in height to accommodate
/// text that requires more than 1 line.
///
/// Notes and constraints:
/// - Due to word wrap, the labels may not use up all the width available to
///   them, so there is usually some unused spacing between them. In extreme
///   cases, however, the spacing may shrink to 0. This is in accordance to how
///   UITableViewCellStyleValue1 cells behave.
/// - By default the two text labels take up an equal amount of horizontal
///   space. This can lead to wasted space, because when one of the labels uses
///   only a short text and does not use its allotted space then the other label
///   does not automatically get the unused space. The @e descriptionLabel
///   property can be set to change the horizontal space distribution.
/// - TableViewVariableHeightCell does not support indentation or showing an
///   image
/// - TableViewVariableHeightCell is not tested in table views that do not have
///   grouped style
///
/// @note The implementation of TableViewVariableHeightCell is based on
/// UIStackView, which does all of the layouting heavy-lifting, and the use of
/// layout guides. Before UIStackView and layout guides were available (iOS 8
/// and before) the implementation of TableViewVariableHeightCell was much more
/// complicated and there were a lot of limitations.
