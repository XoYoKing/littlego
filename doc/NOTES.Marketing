Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains "marketing" notes, which are mostly notes on what to do
to advertise the app in Apple's app store.


App Store page content
----------------------

Little Go is a free and open source iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad. You can play against another human (on the same device), or against the computer. The computer player is powered by the open source software library Fuego (http://fuego.sf.net/). The minimum requirement for running this version of Little Go is iOS 8.1.

Features:
- Board sizes between 7x7 and 19x19 (start a new game to change the board size)
- Let the computer player make a move for you
- Calculate the score at any time during the game (area scoring is the default, territory scoring can be selected at the start of a new game)
- Adjust the computer's playing strength and resign behaviour by selecting from a number of presets, or by fine-tuning advanced settings
- Play even games, or games with 2-9 handicap stones (fixed stone placement)
- Select from 5 pre-defined rulesets when you start a new game, or adjust game rules to your preference (komi, ko rule, area/territory scoring system, number of passes to end game, resume play by alternating/non-alternating play, four passes end game)
- View board positions for moves played earlier during the game (no support for game variations, though)
- Discard moves (aka "undo")
- Display move numbers and coordinate labels
- Zoom & scroll board
- Display player influence (aka territory statistics) for an estimate who owns an area
- Computer vs. computer game for entertainment
- Save & load games to/from the archive
- Use iTunes file sharing to transfer saved games to/from your iOS device
- Import/export game files from/to other apps on your device (e.g. Mail, DropBox)
- In-app user manual (text-only)
- Submit bug report email from inside the app (yes, this *is* a feature :-))
- For the technically inclined: Watch what happens behind the scenes when Little Go and Fuego talk to each other over the Go Text Protocol (GTP)

Your contribution in any form (coding, UI design, testing, bug reports, creating an app video preview, website design) is welcome - please contact me or visit the project website (http://littlego.herzbube.ch/) to find out more.

App Store screenshots
---------------------
App Store Screenshots are prepared in the simulator. The content is the same
for all devices. iPhone screenshots are taken in portrait orientation, iPad
screenshots are taken in landscape orientation.

Before starting to take screenshots, prepare each simulator as follows:

- Remove the app from the simulator
- Install a clean new build
- Add the following .sgf files to the archive:
  - 9x9_1.sgf
  - 9x9_2.sgf
  - Anonymous vs. Fuego 1.sgf
  - game_050.sgf
  - Blood-vomiting game.sgf
  - Ear-reddening\ game.sgf
  - Lee's Broken Ladder Game.sgf
  - Fuego vs. Fuego.sgf
- Launch the app
- Load "Lee's Broken Ladder Game.sgf"
- Go to board position 97


Screenshots
- Screenshot 1: Start placing a stone, then take a screenshot while the
  magnifying glass is visible
- Screenshot 2: Take a screenshot from the "Settings > Display" screen
- Screenshot 3: Take a screenshot from the "Archive" screen
- Screenshot 4: Take a screenshot from the "Help" screen
- Screenshot 3: Take a screenshot from the "Diagnostics > GTP Log" screen


App Store app preview
---------------------
This section contains a possible "screenplay" for an App Store app preview
movie. The aim is to highlight the most important features of the app. An
initial attempt to realize this showed, however, that the screenplay is probably
too long: Even with a severly compressed timeline and rather aggressive cutting,
the resulting movie was almost 1.5 minutes long, which is 3 times as long as
the maximum length allowed by Apple.

Preparations
- Select the device on which to record
- Delete app, reinstall app, launch app
- Settings
  - Scoring > Find dead stones = off
  - Players & Profiles > Rename "Anonymous" to "Patrick"

    computer calculations don't take too long during the video)

    mechanism. The game must have the following characteristics:

    - Two or three groups that can be marked dead
    - The last move in the game must be by white, i.e. it must be black's turn
- Settings in "New game" screen
  - Board size = 19x19

  - Perform a DropBox export into a subfolder "sgf", so that the private content
    of the DropBox root folder need not be exposed during the demo
