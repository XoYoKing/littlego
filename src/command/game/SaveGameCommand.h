/// @brief The SaveGameCommand class is responsible for saving the current
/// game to the archive.
///
/// SaveGameCommand uses SgfcKit to encode the information in the current
/// GoGame and its associated objects to the SGF format. If a game with the same
/// name already exists, it is overwritten. If an error occurs, SaveGameCommand
/// displays an alert.
///
/// SaveGameCommand makes sure that the resulting .sgf file includes all moves
/// of the game, even if the user currently views an old board position.
///
/// SaveGameCommand takes the following precautions in order not to overwrite
/// an already existing game needlessly:
/// - It first validates the generated SGF content using SgfcKit's validation
///   mechanism. This is essentially a dry run of a full write cycle, the only
///   exception being that the SGF content is not written to disk but to memory.
/// - If validation is successful the SGF content is then written to a temporary
///   file. Only if that filesystem interaction succeeds is the existing game
///   overwritten with the temporary file.
///
/// SaveGameCommand executes synchronously.
