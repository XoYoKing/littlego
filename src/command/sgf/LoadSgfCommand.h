/// @brief The LoadSgfCommand class is responsible for loading an SGF file.
///
/// LoadSgfCommand uses SgfcKit to read the content of the SGF file.
/// LoadSgfCommand performs the read operation with arguments taken from
/// SgfcSettingsModel. LoadSgfCommand makes the result of the operation
/// available as SGFCDocumentReadResult object.
///
/// LoadSgfCommand performs up to two attempts to read the SGF file. The number
/// of attempts is determined by the "encoding mode" user preference. If two
/// read attempts are made the result of both attempts is available separately.
///
/// LoadSgfCommand execution is considered successful if an
/// SGFCDocumentReadResult exists. This means that command execution is
/// successful even if the actual read operation performed by SgfcKit failed
/// due to a fatal error. Whoever invoked LoadSgfCommand is responsible for
/// evaluating the messages in the SGFCDocumentReadResult and taking the
/// appropriate action.
///
/// LoadSgfCommand executes synchronously.
