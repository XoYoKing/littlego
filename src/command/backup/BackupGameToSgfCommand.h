/// @brief The BackupGameToSgfCommand class is responsible for saving the
/// current game to an .sgf file so that the most important aspects of the game
/// can be restored when the application re-launches after a crash or after it
/// was killed while suspended.
///
/// BackupGameToSgfCommand stores the .sgf file in a fixed location in the
/// application's library folder. Because the file is not in the shared document
/// folder, it is visible/accessible neither in iTunes, nor on the in-app tab
/// "Archive".
///
/// BackupGameToSgfCommand delegates the .sgf saving task to SaveSgfCommand.
/// The resulting .sgf file includes all moves of the game, even if the user
/// currently views an old board position. If the backup file already exists it
/// is overwritten. If an error occurs BackupGameToSgfCommand does not display
/// an alert, this is the task of whoever invokes BackupGameToSgfCommand.
///
/// BackupGameToSgfCommand executes synchronously.
///
/// @see SaveSgfCommand
/// @see RestoreGameFromSgfCommand.
/// @see ApplicationStateManager.
