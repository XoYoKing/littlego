/// @brief The BoardPositionListViewController class is responsible for managing
/// the "board position list view", which is a collection view in #UIAreaPlay
/// that displays the board positions of the current game.
///
/// BoardPositionListViewController is a child view controller. It is used for
/// #UITypePhonePortraitOnly only.
///
/// The board position list view displays a series of small collection view
/// cells, each of which represents one of the board positions of the current
/// game. A board position cell displays information about the move that caused
/// the board position to come into existence. Even though a pass move does not
/// place a new stone on the board, it nevertheless creates a new board position
/// and is therefore listed by the board position list view.
///
/// A special cell is displayed for board position 0, i.e. the beginning of
/// the game. This cell displays a few bits of information about the game
/// itself (e.g. komi, handicap).
///
/// The board position in the current game's GoBoardPosition instance (i.e. the
/// board position currently displayed by the Go board) is specially marked up.
///
///
/// @par User interaction
///
/// The board position list view is a collection view that lets the user browse
/// through the existing board positions by scrolling.
///
/// The user can select a board position by tapping the cell that represents
/// it. This results in the Go board being updated to display the selected board
/// position.
///
///
/// @par Number of board positions changes
///
/// The content of the board position list view is updated whenever the number
/// of board positions changes in the game's GoBoardPosition instance. Usually
/// this does not result in an update of the scrolling position. There is,
/// however, one exception: If the board position list view currently displays
/// board positions that no longer exist. In this scenario,
/// BoardPositionListViewController places the new scrolling position so that
/// the next view update displays the last board position of the game (this
/// simple solution is possible because only board positions towards the end of
/// the game can be discarded).
///
///
/// @par Current board position changes
///
/// The scroll position of the board position list view is updated in response
/// to a change of the current board position in the game's GoBoardPosition
/// instance. The following rules apply:
/// - The scroll position is not updated if the cell for the new board position
///   is at least partially visible
/// - The scroll position is updated if the cell for the new board position is
///   not visible at all. The scroll position is set so that the cell is fully
///   in view, either centered in the collection view (if there are other cells
///   both on the left and the right) or on the left or on the right edge of
///   the collection view (if there are no more cells to the left or to the
///   right).
///
///
/// @par Delayed updates
///
/// BoardPositionListViewController utilizes long-running actions to delay
/// view updates.
///
/// Methods in BoardPositionListViewController that need to update something in
/// the board position list view should not trigger the update themselves,
/// instead they should do the following:
/// - Set one of several "needs update" flags to indicate what needs to be
///   updated. For each type of update there is a corresponding private bool
///   property (e.g @e numberOfItemsNeedsUpdate).
/// - Invoke the private helper delayedUpdate(). This helper will immediately
///   invoke updater methods if no long-running action is currently in progress,
///   otherwise it will do nothing.
///
/// When the last long-running action terminates, delayedUpdate() is invoked,
/// which in turn invokes all updater methods (since now no more actions are in
/// progress). An updater method will always check if its "needs update" flag
/// has been set.
