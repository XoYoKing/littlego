      <p>Little Go would not have been possible without the help and previous
      work of many people. In particular I would like to thank those of you who
      have directly contributed to this project:</p>

      <dt>App icon</dt>
      <dd>
        Daniel Máslo, for crafting the beautiful app icon. To see more of

      <dt>Stone artwork</dt>
      <dd>
        Justin Weiss, for giving me permission to use the stone artwork he
        created for his app
        <a href="https://github.com/justinweiss/dragongoclient">Dragon Go Client</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Go board wooden texture</dt>
      <dd>
        psdGraphics, for allowing the free use of their artwork in non-profit
        projects such as Little Go. The wooden texture that is used by Little Go
        to draw the Go board comes
        <a href="http://www.psdgraphics.com/backgrounds/light-wooden-background/">from
        the psdGraphics website</a>.

      <dt>Beta-testing</dt>
      <dd>
        Martin Müller and Bruce V. Schwartz, for their valuable time and
        feedback, which gave me the courage to publish the first version of
        Little Go.

        Little Go woefully is no exception to this rule.

    <p class="section" id="fuegoproject-section">
      Thanks to the <a href="http://fuego.sf.net/">Fuego project</a> and its
      developers, for creating a freely usable Go engine in the first place, but
      also for encouraging me to use their engine despite some legal
      uncertainties regarding the LGPL license.

    <p class="section-header">Sen:te</p>
    <p class="section" id="sente-section">
    Thanks to <a href="http://www.sente.ch/">Sen:te</a>, for creating the
    Mac OS X app <a href="http://gobanapp.com/">Goban</a>. Nowadays they sell
    the app for money in the Mac App Store, but once upon a time the app was
    available free of charge, and an early version was even published under
    an open source license
    (<a href="https://github.com/herzbube/freegoban">link to snapshot</a>).
    In those good old days, Goban belonged to my cherished collection of
    Mac OS X applications that are hidden gems, and for a long time I hoped that
    Sen:te would port Goban to iOS. Alas, this never happened, so I had to come
    up with something of my own - the result is Little Go.

    <p class="section-header">Sensei's Library</p>
    <p class="section" id="senseislibrary-section">
      Thanks to <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/">Sensei's Library</a> for
      providing a wealth of information on Go that I could consult whenever I
      had any doubts about one of the rules and concepts of the game.

    <p class="section-header">Tetsuki and Goban</p>
    <p class="section" id="tetsukigoban-section">
      Thanks to the two iPhone apps Tetsuki (nowadays called "Pandanet") and
      Goban (the latter <em>not</em> by Sen:te), for inspiration how to design
      certain aspects of Little Go's user interface.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Stack Overflow, coders and bloggers</p>
    <p class="section" id="coders-and-bloggers-section">
      Last but not least, thanks to the
      <a href="http://http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow community</a>,
      and to countless other coders and bloggers who freely share their
      knowledge and experience without regard to personal profit. Not only do we
      all, programmers and users alike, benefit from this enormously, it also
      shows us what we need to do to create a better world: Work together
      instead of fighting each other!
