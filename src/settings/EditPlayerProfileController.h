// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The EditPlayerProfileController class is responsible for managing
/// user interaction on the "Edit/New Player" and the "Edit Profile" views.
///
/// EditPlayerProfileController provides two views which are very similar:
/// - The "Edit/New Player" view allows the user to edit all the information
///   associated with a Player object and to edit basic information associated
///   with the GtpEngineProfile object that is referenced by the Player.
/// - The "Edit Profile" view allows the user to edit basic information
///   associated with a GtpEngineProfile object only.
///
/// "Basic information" associated with a GtpEngineProfile object means: The
/// user can adjust only the profile's playing strength and resign behaviour
/// by selecting one of several pre-defined combinations of settings. Tweaking
/// the individual settings of a profile is delegated to
/// EditPlayingStrengthSettingsController and
/// EditResignBehaviourSettingsController, respectively.
///
/// @note EditPlayerProfileController presents its view in a manner that blurs
/// the distinction between players and profiles. Experience over the years has
/// shown that many users are confused by the distinctions, and those users
/// that can understand the distinction don't really need it.
///
/// The view managed by EditPlayerProfileController is a generic UITableView
/// whose input elements are created dynamically by EditPlayerProfileController.
/// The controller runs in one of two modes, depending on which convenience
/// constructor is used to create the controller instance:
/// - Create mode: The player and profile whose attributes are edited do not
///   exist yet, the user must tap a "create" button to confirm that the player
///   and profile should be created.
/// - Edit mode: The player and profile whose attributes are edited already
///   exists. Changes cannot be undone, they are immediately written to the
///   Player and GtpEngineProfile model objects.
///
/// EditPlayerProfileController expects to be displayed by a navigation
/// controller, either presented modally (create mode) or pushed on the
/// controller's navigation stack (edit mode). For this reason it populates its
/// own navigation item with controls that are then expected to be displayed in
/// the navigation bar of the parent navigation controller.
///
/// EditPlayerProfileController expects to be configured with a delegate that
/// can be informed when the user makes any changes. For this to work, the
/// delegate must implement the protocol EditPlayerProfileDelegate.
