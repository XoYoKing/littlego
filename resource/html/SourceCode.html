    <p class="section-header">Little Go source code</p>
    <p>
      Little Go is an open source project, which means that not only you do not
      pay for the app in the App Store, but also that you can get a copy of the
      program source code at no cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GitHub project website <a href="https://github.com/herzbube/littlego">https://github.com/herzbube/littlego</a>
      is where you can download the current version, and also older versions,
      of Little Go's source code. Please consult the README.developer document
      to find out more about how to build the program executable with Xcode.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Apple's "iOS Developer Program"</p>
    <p>
      Please be aware that in order to run your own version of Little Go on a
      real iOS device (not just in the simulator), let's say your own iPhone,
      you must be enrolled in Apple's "iOS Developer Program". At the time of
      writing, Apple charges an annual fee to participate in the program, as
      well as requiring you to agree to certain terms that govern the program.
