/// @brief The ComputerSuggestMoveCommand class is responsible for letting the
/// computer player generate a move suggestion and for initiating display of
/// the suggestion to the user.
///
/// ComputerSuggestMoveCommand submits a "reg_genmove" command to the GTP
/// engine. The GTP command is executed asynchronously, i.e. control returns to
/// the submitter of ComputerSuggestMoveCommand before the computer player
/// has actually generated a suggestion. When the GTP response finally arrives
/// ComputerSuggestMoveCommand initiates the display of the received suggestion
/// by sending the notification #computerPlayerGeneratedMoveSuggestion.
///
/// While the GTP command is executing GoGame::reasonForComputerIsThinking()
/// property is set so that observers can react and disable user interaction
/// where appropriate.
