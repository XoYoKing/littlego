/// @brief The ComputerPlayMoveCommand class is responsible for letting the
/// computer player make a move (even if it is not his turn).
///
/// ComputerPlayMoveCommand submits a "genmove" command to the GTP engine, then
/// updates GoGame so that it generates a GoMove of the appropriate type for
/// the player whose turn it is (not necessarily a computer player).
///
/// Another ComputerPlayMoveCommand is submitted automatically if it is now
/// the computer player's turn to move.
///
/// @note The GTP command is executed asynchronously, i.e. control returns to
/// the submitter of ComputerPlayMoveCommand before the computer player's move
/// has actually been generated. This allows the GUI to remain responsive. When
/// the GTP response finally arrives, it triggers a callback to the code in
/// ComputerPlayMoveCommand.
