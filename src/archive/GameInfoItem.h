/// @brief The GameInfoItem class collects data used to represent one of the
/// potentially many games stored inside an SGF file.
///
/// GameInfoItem can be used in one of two major forms, which one is determined
/// by the way how GameInfoItem is initialized.
///
/// - Form 1: GameInfoItem is initialized with an SGFCGoGameInfo object.
///   GameInfoItem processes the data in the SGFCGoGameInfo object and makes it
///   available in a stringified format suitable for display in the UI.
/// - Form 2: GameInfoItem is initialized with a single descriptive text.
///   GameInfoItem in this case serves as a placeholder for a game stored inside
///   an SGF file. This is intended for representing games in the UI that cannot
///   be processed by the app. Typical scenarios are: a game that is not a Go
///   game, or a game that uses a board size that is not supported by the app.
///   GameInfoItem objects initialized with a descriptive text ignore
///   GameInfoItemDetailLevel (see below).
///
/// Clients can freely use the properties of GameInfoItem to display whatever
/// data they want in the UI in whatever way they choose.
///
/// GameInfoItem also provides methods resembling those in the
/// UITableViewDataSource protocol to facilitate the display of its data in a
/// UITableView. These methods use the same signature as the
/// UITableViewDataSource protocol methods, but have an additional
/// GameInfoItemDetailLevel argument. A client that adopts the
/// UITableViewDataSource protocol (typically a UITableViewController) can
/// forward the calls it receives to GameInfoItem and add the desired
/// GameInfoItemDetailLevel value. GameInfoItem reacts by returning different
/// section or row numbers depending on how much level of detail the client
/// desired.
///
/// Different clients that use the same GameInfoItem as a data source at the
/// same time (e.g. overlapping table view controllers) can query GameInfoItem
/// with different detail levels. The same client, however, obviously must use
/// a consistent detail level across all of its queries to receive consistent
/// results.
///
/// @note Which data points make up a given detail level is currently hardcoded
/// into GameInfoItem. If it seems useful in the future GameInfoItem can be
/// extended to support a mechanism with which a client can choose between
/// data points.
